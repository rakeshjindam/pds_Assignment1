Based on the data in the table above, we can construct a prediction model for frailty (Height, Weight, Age, Grip strength). Frailty may be predicted using new data with those four criteria. The three steps of a replicable process are as follows:
Stage 1 : 
Examine each attribute and describe it in detail, explaining how it is measured and how it could impact the findings. Save all of the explanation in a text file (Readme.txt). Furthermore save the frailty data.csv file with the about table's data.
Stage 2 :
After data visualization, there are no incorrect, illogical, or missing values (scatter plot). As a result, we are able to immediately construct a predictive model with raw data.
Stage 3 :
Match the information to several frailty detection models, and then examine the output of those models.
These three phases make up the reproducible workflow for the specified table.
